# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an educational project created to improve my understanding of fundamental computer science algorithms by visualizing how they work step by step.

## Motivation
Algorithms are a core part of computer science and engineering. This project was created to move beyond theoretical understanding and explore how algorithms behave during execution.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort (planned)

## How It Works
The project displays an array of values as vertical bars. During algorithm execution, the bars change their positions to visually represent comparisons and swaps.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of algorithmic thinking
- Practical experience with JavaScript logic
- Better visualization of abstract computer science concepts

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms
- Display time complexity comparisons
- Improve animations and performance
