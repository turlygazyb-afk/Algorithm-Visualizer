# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an educational computer science project created to improve understanding of fundamental algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step execution.

The project focuses on algorithmic thinking, logical problem-solving, and clear representation of abstract concepts through interactive visualization.

## Motivation
Algorithms are a core component of computer science and engineering. While studying algorithms theoretically, it can be difficult to fully understand how they operate during execution.  
This project was created to bridge that gap by transforming abstract algorithmic processes into a visual and interactive learning tool.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  

Each algorithm is visualized using vertical bars that represent array elements. Changes in position reflect comparisons and swaps performed by the algorithm.

---

## How It Works
- A random array of values is generated and displayed as vertical bars  
- Sorting algorithms process the array step by step  
- Each comparison and swap is visualized in real time  
- Delays are used to clearly demonstrate the algorithm’s behavior  

This approach allows users to observe how simple logical rules lead to an ordered result.

## Connection to Mathematics and Physics
From a mathematical perspective, the project relies on ordering, comparisons, and algorithmic complexity, which are closely related to logical proofs and structured reasoning.

From a physics perspective, the visualization can be interpreted as a system evolving over time. Each bar represents an object whose position changes according to defined rules, similar to how physical systems respond to constraints and interactions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Deeper understanding of sorting algorithms  
- Improved algorithmic and logical thinking  
- Practical experience with JavaScript control flow  
- Better ability to explain abstract concepts visually

## Project Reflection
Working on this project helped me understand algorithms not only as abstract concepts, but as dynamic processes. Visualizing each step made it easier to see how individual decisions affect the overall outcome.

This experience strengthened my interest in computer science and engineering by showing how mathematical reasoning and structured logic can be translated into interactive tools.
